This is my project for the Artificial Intelligence course at the Faculty of Mathematics and informatics.
It is an AI that plays the board game Quixo. The rules can be found
[here](http://www.math.uaa.alaska.edu/~afkjm/ai_games/quixo/quixo.html) and this site is also one of the inspirations for the assignment.
This implementation allows for either a human or bot players and there are several different types of bots.
Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3 all use Minimax algorithm with Alpha-beta pruning. The difference between them is the heuristic function.
There is also a bot type that uses the Hill Climb algorithm.
